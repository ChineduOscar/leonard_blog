            It all became a flickering light when Leonard Jr. won the best poet
            of the year twice in 2012 and 2013 from the Caritas University
            Literary and Arts Association (CAULAA). During his first Degree in
            Caritas University Enugu, his name echoed all over the Institution
            because of his poetry renditions in notable events and festivals
            hosted around the school, they gave him a name 'Leonard is Back' – a
            name carved out of one of his poetic renditions titled 'Leonard is
            Back' – the poetry rendition had the audience chorusing the word
            'Leonard is Back' found at the end of each verse of the poem.

            It was their best of him for the poem was rhythmic and the content
            served as a voice to the voiceless students in the institution. In
            2016, Leonard graduated from Caritas University Enugu with a BSC in
            Political Science. While he was waiting for his National Youth
            Service (NYSC) call up letter, He turned his writings to the Social
            media (Facebook) where he got a lot of recognitions and awards. He
            was awarded a certificate as the ‘Big Squire’ of the World Union of
            Poets, 2016 after compiling the Anthology of Peace for the World
            Union of Poets (WUP) published by Atunis Poetry in 2016 .

            He also became the coordinator of the Creative Writers Association
            of Nigeria (CWAN) Enugu state chapter 2016-2018. In 2017, Leonard
            became a Laureate at the World Nations Writers Union (WNWU) 2017;
            accompanied with a certificate. After his Youth Service Corps in
            2017, he returned to his hometown, Nsukka and obtained a Masters
            Degree (MSC) in International Relations at the University of Nigeria
            Nsukka. The same year, he published his first poetry collection in
            Author House USA, with the pseudonym “Leonard D Great”. The name was
            given to him by Author House because the first poem in the
            collection was titled ‘Leonard the Great’, and as an American
            publisher, marketing a book by its cover and author name is
            paramount. There – somehow, Leonard Ugwu took the name and made it
            his.

          The journey of this writer became even more resilient when he embarked
          towards institutionalizing literature in his environment. In 2018, he
          formed the Words and Arts Literary association, encompassing of
          literary enthusiast and young talents ready to learn art, craft and
          creative writing, this association was duly registered as an
          association in the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, they held meetings
          on the first and last Saturdays of every month. Their meetings
          comprised of literary readings, criticisms, spoken words, on the spot
          writing, lectures and annual events/ awards. This association have
          grown to organize many literary reading and events in the University,
          inviting prominent Authors for readings like Chimalum Nwankwo,
          Chijioke Amu-Nnadi, Greg Mbajiorgu, Norbert Oyibo Eze, Ozioma
          Onuzulike, Etc.

            Despite Leonard’s academic endowment in Political and International
            Studies, he felt something was missing in his life, something about
            him, something about his dream, something about his destiny,
            something about his passion. As a creative writer who had studied
            political science almost to a PhD level, something was missing, may
            be the desire to read more literary books, maybe the knowledge of
            literary criticism, may be the ability to get more ideas or
            theoretical analysis and implant them in his books. There was
            something missing, a vacuum he couldn't fathom. This vacuuming
            desire and passion for creative writing made him go for a second
            degree; a Post Graduate Diploma (PGD) in English and Literary
            Studies, at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka which he completed in
            2023. Currently Leonard Ifeanyi Ugwu is a Lecturer at the Institute
            of African Studies (IAS), University of Nigeria, Nsukka. He is also
            a Doctoral researcher (PhD in view) at the same University. His
            writings have appeared in variety of prestigious journals,
            anthologies, magazines, e-zines, and websites around the globe like
            Brittle paper, Oddball Magazine, Spillwords press, Atunis poetry and
            others. He is the author of two poetry collections and a play book:
